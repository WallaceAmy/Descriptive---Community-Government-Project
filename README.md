## 🏢 Community Well-being & Infrastructure Utilisation Analysis<br>
## 📊 Project Overview:
The community government seeks to understand how different factors influence public well-being and the utilisation of local infrastructure. 
This project will apply descriptive analytics to analyse various datasets related to demographics, infrastructure access, well-being indicators, and community engagement.
Uncover patterns, identify key influencing factors, and generate insights that can inform policy decisions, resource allocation, and infrastructure improvements.<br><br>

## 🎯 Key Objectives:
<details><summary>Show Key Objectives</summary><br>

### 🔢Identify Key Community Well-being Indicators
- Measure central tendency, dispersion, and positional metrics for key variables such as household income, health outcomes, and infrastructure usage.<br>
### 🧠Determine Correlations & Variable Relationships
- Analyse demographic, geographic, and behavioral factors affecting infrastructure utilisation.
- Identify key variables influencing community engagement and satisfaction.<br>
### 🔄Predict Infrastructure Demand & Service Utilization
- Use regression models and probabilistic analysis to predict demand for public infrastructure (parks, public transport, libraries, community centers).<br>
### 🌍Assess Regional Disparities
- Compare geographical clusters to determine which communities experience inequitable access to resources.<br>
### 💡Generate Actionable Insights for Policy Recommendations
- Provide evidence-backed suggestions for policy improvements, funding allocation, and strategic development.<br><br>

## 🧪 Hypothesis Design & Testing Approach:
 <details><summary>Hypotheses:</summary><br>
- Communities with higher income levels have higher infrastructure utilisation rates.<br>
- Proximity to public transportation correlates with increased employment rates and well-being scores.<br>
- Areas with more community events report higher civic engagement and trust in government.<br>
- Underfunded regions experience lower satisfaction with government services.<br><br>

<details><summary>Statistical Methods:</summary>summary>
Descriptive Statistics:
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range, IQR)
- Measures of position (percentiles, quartiles, z-scores)<br>
Regression Analysis:
- Linear Regression for predicting infrastructure demand
- Logistic Regression for analyzing categorical outcomes (e.g., public transport use: Yes/No)<br>
Correlation & Probability Models:
- Pearson & Spearman Correlation Coefficients
- Bayesian Inference for predictive probabilities<br>
Geospatial & Demographic Analysis:
- K-Means Clustering for identifying regional disparities
- Heatmaps for resource allocation
